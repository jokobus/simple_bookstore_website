# Simple Bookstore Website

This is a simple static website I once built to showcase books in a gallery format. It includes a main page (`index.html`), an imprint/legal notice (`imprint.html`), and basic styling and scripts. The code is now published for anyone who might find it useful or wants to adapt it for their own purposes.

## Features
- Responsive image gallery for books
- Modal preview with Amazon link integration
- Basic imprint and privacy information
- Minimal dependencies (pure HTML, CSS, JS)

## Disclaimer
**Important:**
Everyone who uses this code must check and adapt the imprint (`imprint.html`) and all legal information themselves. I do **not** take any responsibility for the correctness, completeness, or legal compliance of the imprint or any other content. Use at your own risk.
